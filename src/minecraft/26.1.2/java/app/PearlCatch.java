/**
 * Pearl Catch: on its bind (or your right-click with a pearl, with On right-click), throws
 * the pearl along your view, works out its whole flight, and throws a wind charge after it
 * on the straight line that meets it mid-air. A pearl that hits a wind charge lands there
 * (wind charges are redirectable projectiles, which other projectiles collide with), so you
 * teleport to that point in the air.
 *
 * The flight is the game's own: a pearl leaves from 0.1 below your eyes at 1.5 blocks a
 * tick plus your movement, then each tick loses 0.03 to gravity, keeps 99% of its speed and
 * moves (ThrowableProjectile.tick). A wind charge leaves from your eyes at 1.5 plus your
 * movement and flies straight without slowing (AbstractWindCharge: no acceleration, inertia
 * 1). The game adds a small random spread to both, so a catch can still miss by a little.
 * The pearl looks for the charge along its move each tick, against where the charge was
 * before its own move; the meet point is put on that move.
 *
 * Both fly at 1.5, so the charge cannot go at once: it makes up the pearl's head start by
 * taking the short, straight way. It waits on the charge's slot for the tick that puts it on
 * the chosen point, then turns only the throw toward it (your camera never moves) and
 * switches back to your slot.
