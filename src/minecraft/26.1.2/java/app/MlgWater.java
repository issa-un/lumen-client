/**
 * MLG Water: when a fall would hurt you at least as much as the Min damage setting, places
 * water on the ground below you before you land, so you land in water and take no fall
 * damage, then scoops it back up.
 *
 * The water goes down as soon as the ground is within the bucket's reach (4.5 blocks from
 * your eyes, about 3 from your feet), aimed straight down, so it is there before you are.
 * Landing is predicted with the same calculation as the Landing readout. It waits a game
 * tick after you land before scooping, so the server has handled your landing in the water
 * first. Water is not placed over lava or in the Nether, or when the landing is already safe.
 * Your view really turns down to place and to scoop, then back to where you were looking.
