/**
 * Web Escape: when you are stuck in a cobweb, or on fire, places water from your hotbar and
 * scoops it straight back up once the web is gone or the fire is out.
 *
 * Water put straight into a cobweb destroys it at once; flowing water also destroys webs,
 * but it spreads only every 5 ticks (0.25 s). A bucket used from inside a web always puts
 * its water next to that web, never into it (see BucketUse), so:
 * - Web at your feet only: water goes in the block your head is in and flows down, 0.25 s.
 * - Web at your head: water goes above your head and flows down through the head web, 0.25 s,
 *   then through a web at your feet, another 0.25 s.
 * - Webs at head and feet with two water buckets: one goes straight into the feet web (aimed
 *   up from inside the head web, which puts it in the block below), clearing it at once,
 *   and the other above your head, so both are gone after 0.25 s.
 * If webs still touch you once the water should have reached them (a web trap), it scoops
 * and goes again, up to three times. On fire, water goes at your feet and comes back up as
 * soon as the fire is out. Nothing happens in the Nether, where water boils away. Your view
 * really turns to place and to scoop, then back to where you were looking.
