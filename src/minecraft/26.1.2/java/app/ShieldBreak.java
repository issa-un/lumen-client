/**
 * Shield Break: on your bind, if the target under your crosshair is holding up a shield
 * toward you, swaps to a weapon that disables shields (an axe) and hits the shield up to
 * Axe hits times, one game tick apart, then with Mace follow-up hits with the mace and
 * swaps back. Each step can first wait a random time in its delay's range (Swap delay,
 * Hit delay, Between hits, Axe to mace, Swap back); at 0 they all go at once. The axe disables the shield for its weapon's time (5 s for axes), and the
 * blocked hit leaves the target's damage immunity at 0 damage, so the mace hit lands in
 * full; the mace's fall bonus is not cut by the attack cooldown. Extra axe hits are
 * spread over ticks because hits in one tick cannot catch a shield the first one missed;
 * as soon as the shield shows as down, the remaining axe hits are skipped for the mace.
 * With On attack click, your normal attack click is the trigger too: on a blocking
 * target it runs the shield break instead of the plain hit, otherwise it is a normal hit.
 * Your press or click is always the trigger; nothing fires on its own. With Trigger on Any
 * attack, every attack your client sends counts as that click (see AttackHook).
